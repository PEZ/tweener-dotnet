This project gets very little attention from us. Please feel free to contact us if you want to maintain it. If you are a Silverlight developer looking for a more active and more feature rich Tweener solution take a look at Jesse Graupmanns **Artefact Animator** - http://artefactanimator.codeplex.com

(But if you like the idea of something really lightweight, single-file, for your tweening needs, please go ahead and download Tweener.cs from the Downloads section.)

Tweener.Net is a light-weight C# module for easy animation of visible attributes in .Net and Silverlight applications.

At [Projectplace](http://www.projectplace.com/) we found ourselves in need of a Tweener in a .Net project. Failing to find one we made one. Since the problem solved by a Tweener is so general we're now publishing it, hoping others will have use for it and also participate in developing it.

This Tweener is heavily inspired by Zeh Fernando's Flash [Tweener](http://code.google.com/p/tweener/). The C# code took of as an improvement on Miguel Moreno's [Tween.cs](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/tweencs.aspx).

When we say "light weight", we mean it. Although the tweener will probably fatten some with time, it will try to stay simple, lean and easy to use.
